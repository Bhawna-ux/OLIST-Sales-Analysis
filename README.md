Those merchants are able to sell their products through the OLIST store and ship them directly to the customers using OLIST logistics partners.<br>

# Executive Summary
OLIST has experienced consistent growth, with a 21% increase in visitors, a 20% rise in orders, and a 20% boost in sales over the last two years. However during festival seasons particularly in June, customers prefer offline shopping. Maybe it is due to urgent needs to avoid any type of delays. Our data indicate that orders reach customer more promptly but face delivery delays. The overwhelming order volumes identified as a key contributor to carrier delays. 76% customers are satisfied with our services , have positive feedback but with 14% of negative reviews. The zero refund rate suggests either products quality not alligns with customer expectations or the return policy discourages returns. Secutrity and Services is the one of the least likely product. Bed bath table, beauty and toys are most favorite products. Additionally, 74% of the transactions involve credit card payments, with an average of 2.85 installments per purchase. <br>
In summary, addressing delivery delays, especially during high demand period and ensuirng timely customer communication will be critical to improving customer satisfaction.
# Insights
In order to evaluate sales performance , we focused on following key metrics:
* Sales Trends : Analyzed overall sales patterns and sesonal fluctuations to drive more sales. <br>
* Delivery Pattern : Analyzing cause of late deliveries and its effect on customer behvaior. <br>
* Customer Behavior : Investigated customer satisfaction level and reason behind negative reviews. <br>
* Product Analysis : Examined popular and unpopular product categories , priced strategies and customer reviews so that we can offer customers their desirable products. <br>
* Refund Rate : Finding the return rate of sales.
 
 ### Trends
 **How is the overall growth?**
   * There is consistent growth in number of visitors, orders and sales with growth rate 21%, 20%, 20% respectively. <br>
   * In June, each year orders dropped and raised in next month, that is, July. There may two reasons: <br>
   * July often sees winter promotions or back-to-school shopping, so customers may delay purchases till then. <br>
   * Brazil celebrates Festas Juninas throughout June, especially in the northeast. This is more of a cultural/traditional celebration with local events and food rather than consumerism-driven shopping, possibly diverting focus from online shopping. <br>

 ### Delivery Pattern
 **What is the reason behind late deliveries and what causes late deliveries?**
   * The data reveals that orders reach carriers more promptly than they are delivered to customers. This discrepancy attributed to the distance between carrier's and customer's location, overwhelming volume , 
     incorrect address or weather conditions.<br>
   * Analysis of order and visitor trends reveals a high demand during November 2017 and March 2018, leading to delivery delays and contributing to carrier disruptions.<br>
   * So the **overwhelming volume could be the main reason for carrier delays.** <br>
   * **There is a positive correlation between delay and order quantity.(Delay days tend to increase when order quantities increase.)**
