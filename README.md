 ### Delivery Pattern
   * Order reach carriers more promptly than they are delivered to customers. This can be due to long distance, overwhelming volume,weather conditions or incorrect address.<br>
   * There is high demand during November 2017 and 2018 March which causes late delivery spikes.<br>
   * So the **overwhelming volume can be the main reason of carrier delays.** <br>
   * **There is a positive correlation between delay and order quantity.(Delay days tend to increase when order quantities increase.)**
